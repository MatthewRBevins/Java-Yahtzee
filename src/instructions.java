        out.println("When rolling again, you can put aside some dice, based on what you want to score.");
        out.println("The upper section contains scores based on dice numbers. For example, for twos, you have to get as many twos as you can, then add together all your twos at the end. If you had four twos, you would score eight on twos.");

        out.println("Yahtzee is the ultimate score: five dice of the same kind. If you get this, score 50.");
        out.println("If you get another yahtzee in a game, you can get a yahtzee bonus, which adds 100 points to your total.");
        out.println("All of these scores can be completed in any order.");
        out.println("If, at the end of your turn, you cannot score anything, you have to take a 0 on something. For example, if you have only a yahtzee left to score, and do not get it, just type yahtzee, and the computer will score 0 on it.");
